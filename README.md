HTML CSS: Your First Lab!
---

## Objectives

1. Understand how to use the Learn IDE
2. Solve your very first lab
3. Submit your solution using `learn submit` in the IDE

## Instructions

Welcome to your first lab on Learn! We promise, this'll be easy.

The process of working on code labs on Learn involves a few simple steps: You typically start by reading the lab's instructions on Learn in your browser (what you're doing right now). Then, you'll hit the Open button, which will download the code for this lab into your Learn IDE—where you'll write the code to solve the lab. Finally, you submit your solution, and then come back here (to Learn.co) to continue on to the next lesson.

To get started, hit the blue Open button above.

This will pull the files associated with this lab into your Learn IDE and automatically open up the folder containing the lab.

Next, you'll use the Learn IDE to write your first line of HTML code!

In the IDE's file tree (on the left pane), find the file called `my_first_lab.html` and double click on it to open it.

To solve this lab, you'll need to change the text between `<strong>` and `</strong>` so that instead of saying "NAME" it says your name. Remember to save the updated file (otherwise, the change won't go through)! 

(HINT: If you'd like to take a look at your handiwork, you can preview this in your browser by right-clicking the file in the file tree, and selecting "Open in Browser" .)

Then, in the Learn IDE terminal window (that's the pane at the bottom of the IDE), type

``` bash
learn submit
```

and hit enter.

If you've followed along, you'll see a success message and your work will automatically be submitted to Learn and saved to your GitHub account. If you then head back to this lesson's page on Learn.co, you'll see a green completion light next to "Submitted Pull Request" on the right side of the page. To wrap things up, hit the "I'm Done" button allowing you to continue on to the next lesson.

Congratulations — you've just solved your first lab on Learn!
